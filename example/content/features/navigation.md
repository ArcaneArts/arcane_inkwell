## Sidebar Navigation

The sidebar is auto-generated from your folder structure. Each folder with a `_section.json5` becomes a collapsible section.

## Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs show the current path. Visit the [Guide](/guide) section for deeper nesting.

## Previous/Next

Look at the bottom of this page. You'll see links to navigate sequentially through the documentation.
